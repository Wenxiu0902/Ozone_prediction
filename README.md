# Ozone_prediction

## Prepare input data
Data preparation involves ozone station monitoring data (sahsja), multiple meteorological variables data from ERA5_land, OMI remote sensing data (total column concentration and near-surface), socioeconomic data (gdp and population distribution), and land use data. The ew.py file handles ERA5 meteorological data, and remote sensing data processing, while other data are directly downloaded as gridded datasets. These datasets are spatially and temporally matched with station data to obtain input data.
